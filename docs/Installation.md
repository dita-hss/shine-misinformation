# Installation
{:#intro .no_toc}

You may host The Misinformation Game to run your studies for free using
[Google Firebase](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/client/get-firebase).
There are two guides available to walk you through this installation.

1) The [Non-Technical Installation Guide](/NonTechnicalInstallation)
   provides a guide that is aimed for users without IT experience.

2) The [Technical Installation Guide](/TechnicalInstallation)
   provides a guide that is aimed for users with technical
   knowledge, who are comfortable with the command-line.


## Choice of Guide

If you are proficient with the command-line and installing
technical tools, then the 
[technical installation guide](/TechnicalInstallation)
will be quicker, and requires fewer steps. However, if you are
not familiar with these technologies, then the
[non-technical installation guide](/NonTechnicalInstallation)
should be easier to follow. Additionally,
while Firebase has a generous free tier, if you wish to run
large studies or studies with many images, then you should
consult the
[Firebase Pricing Documentation](/FirebasePricing) to estimate
your hosting costs. In our experience, the hosting costs for
the Misinformation Game have been minimal.
