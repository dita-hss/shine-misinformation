# The Results Spreadsheet
{:#intro}

The results for studies can be downloaded from the Admin
Dashboard, by selecting the study, and then selecting
**Download Results**. The results are downloaded as a
.xlsx file that may be opened in any spreadsheet program
such as Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. The results
spreadsheet is split into four worksheets:

1) **[The Overview Worksheet](#overview):**
   This sheet contains information about the study the
   results are from, the number of participants, and when the
   results were downloaded.

2) **[The Posts Worksheet](#posts):**
   This sheet contains all the interactions participants made with
   the posts that they were shown, as well as information about
   those posts.

3) **[The Comments Worksheet](#comments) _(optional)_:**
   This sheet contains the reactions of participants to comments
   on posts. If your study contains no comments, this sheet
   will not be included.

4) **[The Participants Worksheet](#participants):**
   This sheet contains a list of all the participants in the
   study, when they completed the study, and their completion
   codes.
